# CrabInfo
A rusty tool for crabs, or something like that.

## Purpose
I hope to make this into a crabby multitool for getting system information in simple and versatile ways.

In the future I would like it to:
 - receive command line arguements and gratiously spew system details.
 - run as a standalone interactive ~~sla~~... assistant.
 - maybe if I'm feeling ambitious I will add a web server or something.
 - maybe some cool apis. I dunno.
